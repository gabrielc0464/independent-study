# Picking topics

Picking a topic for an independent study is a very important part of the process. It has to be something that you enjoy but at the same
tine it has to be something that can teach you something new. Looking through the topics we were given I wanted to find something that was 
interesting to me but at the same time I wanted something different. I had two topics that I was trying to choose from. One topic was [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/)
which is a program where you can learn javascript or python to create music. Music is something that is very important to me and I thought that it was pretty cool that I could
create music using code. I didn't need to learn an instrument to play music. My second choice was [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/)which is a 2d game development library for ruby 
and c++.
