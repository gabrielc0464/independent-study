# Picking topics

Picking a topic for an independent study is a very important part of the process. It has to be something that you enjoy but at the same
tine it has to be something that can teach you something new. Looking through the topics we were given I wanted to find something that was 
interesting to me but at the same time I wanted something different. I had two topics that I was trying to choose from. One topic was [Earsketch](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/)
which is a program where you can learn javascript or python to create music. Music is something that is very important to me and I thought that it was pretty cool that I could
create music using code. I didn't need to learn an instrument to play music. My second choice was [Gosu](https://www.libgosu.org/) which is a 2d game development library for ruby 
and C++. I love video games so it was a topic that I was immedialtly drawn to.

## Earsketch VS Gosu

What drew me to to Earsketch instead of Gosu was the website for Earsketch and how they teach you how to make music. Earsketch has a very in depth tutorial that teaches you
everything you need to know about the program and how to use it and the program has its own site where you can use the program without having to use an external workspace. 
The tutorial has vidoes that really explain everything that you need to know about the app which is something that alot of these topics don't have.

Gosu also has a tutorial but you have to go to the documentation on github and you have to install gems on a workspace to make it work.
