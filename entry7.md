# Effects in Earsketch

In Earsketch there are many effects that can be used in your code to make your music sound a certain way. 
Earsketch has a section where they explain every effect and what it does but I found that the way that they describe
each one is a little confusing. This is a simplified version of that.

BANDPASS is an effect that filters the frequencies of a track. It can make that track sound like it's coming out of a megaphone or
a small speaker or a telephone. Here is the link to what BANDPASS sounds [like](https://clyp.it/x0clzrbz)
