# Earsketch Making a song in Earsketch

The original plan for this entry was supposed to continue on to the curriculum on the website but I was getting bored just follwoing
the tutorial so I decided to try and make a track. There are many things that go into making a song in any form but here are some 
tips that I have for making a instrumental piece in earksketch

1. Get inspiried 




## Takeaways
- Mess around with the beats to make sure that the track sounds right 
- Listen to remix tracks on youtube and other websites and try to mimick the beat that is being played there.
- Look at other peoples code. On the earsketch website click on competition and you can look at other peoples code and see how they fucntion.
It can give you inspiration for your own code.
