# Earsketch Making a song in Earsketch

The original plan for this entry was supposed to continue on to the curriculum on the website but I was getting bored just follwoing
the tutorial so I decided to try and make a track. There are many things that go into making a song in any form but here are some 
tips that I have for making a instrumental piece in earksketch

1. Get inspiried 

Listen to music that you like and try to make something similar to that. Its a good way to start off if you don't have 
any idea. Make sure not to copy a song because thats just not right.

2. Music Match

In earksketch most instruments have a designated sound. Most instrument sounds have a certain genre included in the name. 
Here's an example:

An easy way to get each music track to sound good together is to pick sounds that have the same genre. Some pieces of music don't mesh well together so it's
easier to pick sounds from the smae genre. You can try and pick sounds from many different genres but you have to test them out together to see how they sound.

3. Ask Around

You don't need to be a musical genious to know what sounds good in a song. Ask the people around you to listen to what you have made and ask them for suggestions.
You will be surprised on how there advice improves your song.

4. Just play around

This might seem as an obvious one but it's kind of difficult. Don't try to make it your focus to make a great song from the get go. Take your time and try out evrything.
Just have fun with it. You will find things that sound good together just by trying out different sounds together.
