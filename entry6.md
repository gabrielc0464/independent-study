# Earsketch Making a song in Earsketch

The original plan for this entry was supposed to continue on to the curriculum on the website but I was getting bored just follwoing
the tutorial so I decided to try and make a track. There are many things that go into making a song in any form but here are some 
tips that I have for making a instrumental piece in earksketch

1. Get inspiried 

Listen to music that you like and try to make something similar to that. Its a good way to start off if you don't have 
any idea. Make sure not to copy a song because thats just not right.

2. Music Match

In earksketch most instruments have a designated sound. Most instrument sounds have a certain genre included in the name. 
Here's an example.

## Takeaways
- Mess around with the beats to make sure that the track sounds right 
- Listen to remix tracks on youtube and other websites and try to mimick the beat that is being played there.
- Look at other peoples code. On the earsketch website click on competition and you can look at other peoples code and see how they fucntion.
