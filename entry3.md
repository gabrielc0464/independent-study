# Earsketch Abstraction

Abstraction in Earksketch is when you make different functions similar to ones like ```fitMedia()``` and ```setEffect()```. You can use these
custom functions to group together other lines of code to make a complicated process much easier and allows you to make more layered pieces
of music in Earsketch. 
To make custom fucntions there are many different ways to do it. One way is to make a for loop to runs your music over and over again at certain points.
## For Loop 
This is the basic python code for a for loop.
```for i in range(2)```
In Python a for loop has 3 different sections.

 The loop body is what the for loop is going to keep on repeating. The code taht you want to loop has to be indented under the for loop or it wont work.
 The loop counter is the name of a variable that has been created for the for loop to work. You can call that variable in other places of your code if you want that
 code in certain places. The range is another function which loops the code a certain number of time. In the example it shows ```range(1,9)``` which means the music will runs
 for 9 measures. At first I didn't understand what the range function actually did so I changed the numbers and saw that when I made the range *(1,8)* it would loop the code
 for a shorter time then before.
 
 Something thta didn't make sense to me was what the measure variable was doing inside the ```fitMedia()```. In order to understand the code you have to see what it looks
 like in the DAW.

The measures are split in half for the first one. For the second one the measures are split into normal sections. The third one is split into 2 measures each.
 

## Takeaways
- Play around with the code to make sure it makes sense to you.
- Try to find videos explaining topics you aren't clear on as it's easier to understand it if you see it visually.
