# Earsketch makeBeat() function and strings


In the previous entry, I talked about another fucntion called the for loop that can be used to add effects to your earketch music file.
This time we are talking about a function that is called makeBeat() which is *obviously* used to make beats. First we have to understand strings
in order to use this fucntion.


















## Takeaways
- Play around with the code to make sure it makes sense to you. 
- Try to find videos explaining topics you aren't clear on as it's easier to understand it if you see it visually.
