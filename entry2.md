# Earsketch Basics

Earsketch has a tutorial on the website that teaches you how to use earsketch and teaches you the basics of the website. I just want to make my own explanation
of the terms that the website using.
The Earksketch website has a basic workspace that you do most of your work in. Here is a picture of it below.

This the basic setup of the Earsketch Workspace. In order to use earsketch and save your programs you need to create an account. You can see on the top right corner
I am already signed in to my account. The Digital audio workspace or the **DAW** is the place where your music pops up and where you can hear the msuic you code. The
code editor is the place where you write your code to make the music. You can create multiple scripts in either Python or Javascript. I forgot what scripts
were exactly so I had to google what it was. A Script in this case is a place where you the user can interact and change what music is being played
and where you can control evry aspect of the music. The icon with the headphones on it is where you can get all of the music clips to use in your code.

You can search up what exact music file you like or you can search by the type of instrument,genre or artist. The folder below that is where your scripts are. You can create 
multiple scripts. Their is also a folder that lists all of the functions that you can use in the workspace. You can do alot in Earsketch but this is just basics of the 
website.
